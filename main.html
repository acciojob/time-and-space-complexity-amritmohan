	   <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First Paragraph -->
    <p>
        Time complexity is a computational concept that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. It helps in determining how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large inputs. Understanding time complexity allows us to choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem, ensuring optimal performance.

    <!-- Second Paragraph -->
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires relative to the size of the input data. It is crucial for determining the feasibility of algorithms when memory resources are limited. A commonly used notation for space complexity is O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Optimizing space complexity can lead to significant improvements in performance, especially in resource-constrained environments.
